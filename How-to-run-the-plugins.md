# Xtext plugin

There's two ways to do this, one within Eclipse when you're coding/debugging/testing etc and one via Maven.

Right click the `sheepdogcukeplugin` project then select `Run As > Eclipse Application`.  It should start another Eclipse Instance.

The plug-in is in the `.repository` directory, it's the zip file. Install the plug-in in Eclipse by selecting `Help > Install New Software > Add > Archive > Open  > Add > Select All > Finish`.
