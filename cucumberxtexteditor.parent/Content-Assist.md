## Initial Generated Files

```

## Usage

The content assist is triggered when you press `CTRL+SPACE`.
I haven't figured out how to have it appear automatically like when you press `.` in Java and suggestions pop up. I'll look into that.
There's a way to add documentation which I'll code later.
