# Code Generation

## Initial Generated Files

```
cucumberxtexteditor/src/org/farhan/generator/CucumberGenerator.xtend
```

## Java vs Xtend Generator

The goal of these example projects is to make it easier to start using Xtext.
Because of that I took the generated `CucumberGenerator.java` file and replaced the `CucumberGenerator.xtend` file.
Later if you like, you can work with Xtend but I generally have stayed away from it.
You'll find the `CucumberGenerator.java` in the `src-gen` source folder.
