# Quick Fix

## Initial Generated Files

```
cucumberxtexteditor.ui/src/org/farhan/ui/quickfix/CucumberQuickfixProvider.java
```

## Usage

With this you can modify the file itself or by generating code.
It's like when using the Java editor you can create a class that doesn't exist or change the method name or type itself.
For now I haven't done anything special with the file modification quick fix.
What I want to do is have it suggest a qualified name for those that don't have a component specified.
Another quick fix is to rename an object path if there's already an object defined but with a different path.
