Tools to make bdd and tdd easier to adopt using lean principles


# Project Goals

## Sharing Knowledge

First, it's to share my knowledge around MDD and MBT etc using Eclipse, EMF, Cucumber, Java, UML, Graph Models, Camunda, Maven.

I'm basically putting all my knowledge that I've accumulated so far using models for coding/testing in this repo as an example.
When I went looking for information 15 years ago and sometimes even today it's a little hard to find it.
It's also hard to find a complete example of how to use frameworks within the [Eclipse Modelling Project](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/modeling). 
Hopefully this makes it easier for someone else who's interested in doing such things.
