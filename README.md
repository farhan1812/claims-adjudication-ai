# Adjudicating Claims with AI

I'm researching how to transform a legacy decades old system to something that uses AI.
Part of that process would be upskilling testers for example so that AI doesn't kill anybody's job or at least not immediately :P. 
Some of what's here I did with my own QA team of about 30+ folks over 3-4 years and other stuff was done in earlier roles as a dev lead.

1. [Project Goals](Project-Goals.md): What I want to achieve.
2. [Project Tasks](Project-Tasks.md): What I'm working on and why.
3. [Project Structure](Project-Structure.md). Where everything is.
