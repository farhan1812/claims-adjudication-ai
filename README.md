# claims-adjudication-ai
Training generative AI to adjudicate claims using data generated from model based testing during shift left testing

I'm basically putting all my knowledge that I've accumulated so far using models for coding/testing in this repo as an example.
When I went looking for information 15 years ago and sometimes even today it's a little hard to find info/examples.
Hopefully this makes it easier for someone else who's interested in doing such things.
