= Maximum

Most the customer pays during the policy period, like a year.
Once this max is reached the insurer pays 100%.
Does this mean deductibles don't matter at that point, like is the maximum supposed to be a cap on deductibles?
That's what I'm interpreting it as for now

The maximum is less than the deductible so only $5 out of the $10 will count
